DESCRIPTION
    In mathematics, Young's lattice is a partially ordered set of Young
    diagrams that is formed by connecting all integer partitions of a given
    diagram. It was named after Alfred Young, who developed the
    representation theory of the symmetric groups. In Young's theory, the
    objects (now called Young diagrams) can be partially ordered by
    inclusion resulting in a so called partially ordered set termed Young's
    lattice.

    Moreover, given M^l it is possible to extract a complete list of
    irreducible subrepresentations (S^l) form a complete list as l varies
    over all possible partitions. Here one such set is computed and its
    representation illustrated using a Hesse diagram:

                                A
                                |
                                B
                              /   \
                            C       D
                              \   /
                                E
                                |
                                F
                                |
                                G

    Where A, B, ...G are Young diagrams depicting a given partition.
